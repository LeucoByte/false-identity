  "considerations": "# CULTURAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR SPAIN\n\n## Social Behavior\n- Spaniards are generally warm, friendly, and expressive in conversation\n- Personal space is smaller than in Northern Europe; close physical proximity is normal\n- Greetings often involve two kisses on the cheeks (right cheek first) among friends and family\n- Direct eye contact is important and shows confidence and honesty\n- Speaking loudly and passionately is common and not considered rude\n\n## Daily Life & Schedule\n- Late meal times: lunch around 2-3 PM, dinner around 9-10 PM or later\n- Siesta culture still exists in smaller towns (businesses close 2-5 PM)\n- Social life happens late: going out at 11 PM-midnight is normal\n- Sunday family lunches are a sacred tradition in many households\n\n## Communication Style\n- Interrupting in conversation is normal and shows engagement, not rudeness\n- Spaniards value directness but maintain politeness\n- Using hands and gestures while speaking is very common\n- Complaining about politics, economy, or weather is a normal conversation starter\n\n## Work Culture\n- Work-life balance is highly valued\n- Long lunch breaks (1.5-2 hours) are still common in many places\n- August is vacation month - many businesses close\n- Personal relationships at work are important\n\n## Social Etiquette\n- Always greet shopkeepers when entering a store (\"Hola, buenos días\")\n- Splitting bills (\"ir a medias\") is becoming more common among younger people\n- Tipping is not mandatory but appreciated (5-10% in restaurants)\n- Dress tends to be more formal/stylish than in Anglo countries\n\n## Food & Drink\n- Coffee culture is huge: café con leche in morning, café solo after meals\n- Tapas culture: eating standing at bars is normal\n- Wine or beer with meals is common and socially acceptable\n- Never rush a meal - dining is a social experience\n\n## Regional Differences\n- Strong regional identities exist (Catalonia, Basque Country, Galicia, Andalusia)\n- Be aware of language sensitivities (Catalan, Basque, Galician speakers)\n- Avoid discussing regional independence issues unless you know the person well\n- Each region has distinct traditions, food, and customs\n\n## Things to Avoid\n- Don't compare Spain to Latin American countries\n- Don't assume everyone likes bullfighting (it's controversial)\n- Don't be overly punctual for social events (15-30 min late is normal)\n- Don't discuss the Civil War or Franco era unless you know the person very well\n",
